# RatavarG

### What is this?

This is a `PHP` application written at `Aug 20, 2013` when I was bored with the current image automatically generated by [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/) in response to the anonymously status of my account. The thing is that I have no longer access to that old account, so before to create a new one with a different email address I've decided to have fun coding a **8-bits Avatar Generator**.

### Installation

Be sure that you have `php5-gd` installed, configured and enabled in you web server. Then you can use a HTML tag like this to generate an image that will change every time you refresh your web browser:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Avatar Generator</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
    <img src="/avatar.php" width="300" height="300" />
</html>
```

If you have `PHP 5` it would be easy to use the built-in development server to test this code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cixtor/ratavarg.git
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t ratavarg
```

There is a demo where you can test the functionality: [view HTML demo](http://cixtor.com/gravatar) - [view Image demo](http://cixtor.com/gravatar/avatar.1234567890.png)

### Image extension

You can change the avatar image extension from _php_ to _png_ or any other image format with a modern PHP Frameworks using **Routes** but in my case I'm using a **HTAccess** redirection. Copy and paste the following code into your `AccessFilename` (generally referred as `.htaccess`):

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    # RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    RewriteRule ^avatar.(png|jpg|gif)$ avatar.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

### What RatavarG means?

It is basically `gravatar` backwards. I don't want to have juridic problems with the copyright policies of [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/).

### What is Gravatar?

According to [Gravatar.com - What is Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/support/what-is-gravatar/):

> An **avatar** is an image that represents a person online, basically a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites. A **Gravatar** is a `Globally Recognized Avatar`. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.

> Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every **WordPress** account and is run and supported by [Automattic](http://automattic.com/).
